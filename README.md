# Calculator-app
A program that allows you to perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers.  The program will then display the result and ask if you want to try again.
# Pseudocode
1. Display a greeting message for the user
2. Display a message reminding the user to use the calculator app wisely
3. Use def function to perform mathematical operations
4. Use if-else statements to know which operation is needed
5. Use def function to get user input
6. Display the options
7. Get user input for the chosen operation
8. An error  message will apper if the user enters an invalid choice
9. Ask the user to input two numbers to perform the operation
10. An error message will appear if the user enter invalid number then ask to enter their choice again
11. Perform the selected operation
12. Print the result
13. Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation with the given choices (yes or no)
14. Use the calculate function to start the program
